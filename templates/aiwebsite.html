    <p>A content hub for Treatwell. This project was kicked off to create a fun and safe place for both B2B and B2C sides of the business during these complicated times. As a hub it has to be scalable, easy to use (for content managers in 11 countries) and give an overall uplifting feeling. I started by drafting some ideas and building wirefranes. As a result I developed a layout which is perfect for scrolling and unwinding. One of the most interesting challenges was to create a Spotify section, where the users could easily scan and find a playlist for their mood. Overall, the page turned out to be structured in a way which takes you on a journey through different aspects of business (for both clients and partners) and has a big viraity of content.
