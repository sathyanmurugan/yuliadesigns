    <h2>Editor UI</h2>
    <p>Introduction of a new AI based feature to a user. The most convenient way was to mix new UI elements with illustrations, explaining the flow. It was an amazing prject where I got to work with a lot of stakeholders and participate in user tests. Working with the editor teams felt exciting, because all of them have their own design systems, rules and limitations. This one is my take on Mac Editor UI.</p>
