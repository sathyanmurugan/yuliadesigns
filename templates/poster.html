        <h2>Product introduction</h2>
        <p>albelli is a company with a mission to print peopleâ€™s photos and bring their moments to life. Our challenge was to introduce a new product to various touch points: app, website, editors. It was also very important to keep in mind that this
          product would appeal to a much younger audience than the dominant customer profile. I started from establishing and understanding who those customers are and how to approach them. After that we could dive into which visual identity we
          should go with.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>I worked on both content creation and supported app/desktop application developers and UX designers to develop top experiences fro our users. It was important to differentiate this product from the rest of albelli range in order to
            attract new customers.</p>
